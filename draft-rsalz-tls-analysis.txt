                    draft-rsalz-tls-analysis-latest

Abstract

   This memo defines a permanent design team, as defned in [WGPROCS],
   for the TLS Working Group.  The team is, repeatedly, chartered to
   decide whether or not a draft that has been adopted by the Working
   Group needs some kind of analysis in order to determine if the
   security guarantees promised for TLS 1.3 are still being met.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a permanent design team, as defned in [WGPROCS],
   for the TLS Working Group (WG).  The team is, repeatedly, chartered
   to decide whether or not a draft that has been adopted by the Working
   Group needs some kind of analysis in order to determine if the
   security guarantees promised for TLS 1.3 are still being met.

   This memo defines procedures for how the TLS Working Group will
   operate.  As such, final publication as an RFC is not required.
   Rather, passage through Working Group Last Call (WGLC) is all that is
   required to ensure WG consensus.  When circumstances change, the WG
   Chairs may determine that another WGLC consensus call is needed.

1.1.  Terminology

   Although this document is not an IETF Standards Track publication, it
   adopts the conventions for normative language to provide clarity of
   instructions to the implementer.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
   "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119]
   [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown
   here.

2.  Background

   TLS 1.3 benefited greatly from collaboration with many notable
   cryptographers during it's development.  Unfortunately, [RFC8446]
   does not have an explicit acknowledgements section.  In February of
   2016, the "TLS 1.3 Ready or Not" [TRON] (TRON) workshop was held, co-
   located with the Network and Distributed system Security [NDSS]
   Symposium held in San Diego, California.  The first half of the
   workshop had several papers analyzing the TLS 1.3 protocol, using
   formal method tools such as Tamarin ([TAMARIN]), ProVerif
   (([PROVERIF]) and classic paper proofs.

   Multiple WG consensus calls over the past 18 months or so, have
   confirmed that the working group would like to see more formal
   analysis of new drafts, to ensure that they do not weaken the
   guarantees that are claimed in [RFC8336] and proven in the TRON
   presentations and subsequent other analyses.

   Anecdotally, it has been relayed to the WG that some of the
   cryptographers who would be most relevant to future analysis do not
   wish to participate in the day-to-day operations of the working
   group.  This has been variously presented as a distraction from their
   "real work," and also that the tenor of the communications has been
   seen as hostile and unwelcoming.

3.  Analysis-Needed Design Group (ANDG)

   This document proposes that a Design Team, as defined in Section 6.5
   of [WGPROCS] and [IESGNOTE], be created.  Unlike other design groups,
   which are formed to address issues of a specific WG document, the
   ANDG will determine, for each document presented to it, if some type
   of formal analysis is needed to verify that the security properties
   of TLS 1.3 still apply.

   For example, adding new types entries into the SSLKEYLOGFILE
   [SSLKEYLOGFILE] format would likely affect the operational security
   of the application using them, it would have no effect on the
   security properties of the TLS 1.3 protocol itself.  On the other
   hand, since a key part of the existing TLS 1.3 analyses centered
   around the key derivation state machine, a document that modified
   that would likely need analysis to show that the existing invariants
   still hold.

3.1.  Engagement with ANDG

   At various points in the lifecycle of a WG document -- adoption,
   development, WGLC -- the ANDG would be engaged.  The actual points in
   the process are left to the discretion of the WG Chairs, confirmed by
   WG rough consensus if necessary.

   Once engaged, the ANDG will decide amongst themselves a contact point
   for the WG Chairs, membership, and document authors.  Any
   communication from the contact point MUST represent the consensus, if
   not full agreement of all involved ANDG participants.

   Note that it is not a requirement that the full ANDG participate in
   all document reviews.  To avoid confusion, the contact point SHOULD
   identify those participating each time a decision is conveyed to the
   WG.

3.2.  ANDG Membership

   The current membership of the ANDG must always be available to the WG
   members, as well as any outside observers.  This memo recommends that
   an "Additional resources" link be created on the DataTracker TLS
   "about" page, with a link to the document.  The document should be
   under change control, either as a new Directorate maintained by the
   DataTracker, or a simple text file with names and affiliations
   maintained in the TLS WG GitHub repository.

   Initial membership in the ANDG will be determined by the WG Chairs.
   ANDG members can leave at any time by emailing "tls-chairs@ietf.org",
   or its equivalent, and letting the Chairs know.

   Anyone may propose new members to the ANDG by submitting their name
   to the "tls@ietf.org" mailing list.  After the Chairs have determined
   there are no strong objections, the person is added.

   Every member of the ANDG MUST to have a DataTracker account and
   profile.  They MAY subscribe to the TLS WG mailing list if they
   desire.

3.3.  ANDG Impact on the WG

   As defined in [WGPROCS], a Design Group has no special authority over
   the WG decisions.  If the ANDG says that analysis is needed, and no
   volunteers can be found, or if the WG disagrees, the document
   proceeds through its normal course of develpment.  When or if
   mentioned in a Shepherd's write-up, the Document Shepherd MAY point
   out that the ANDG suggested analysis.

4.  Relationship to UFMRG

   In general, the IETF Community is also increasingly interested in
   formal methods to verify its protocols and data structures.  The
   Internet Research Steering Group [IRSG] (IRSG) recently created
   Usable Formal Methods Research Group [UFMRG] (UFMRG) to look at how
   the IETF can leverage formal methods to improve the documents it
   generates.

   This document proposes that there SHOULD be a natural collaboration,
   albeit not a formal one, between UFMRG and ANDG.

Acknowledgements

   This draft would have neither been necessary nor possible without the
   initial attempts of the TLS WG Chairs to create a Formal Analysis
   Triage Team (FATT) which did not fit well into the IETF policies and
   procedures.
